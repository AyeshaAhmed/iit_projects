# iit_projects
This repo contains coding projects I did in university.

I understand this is a very loaded repo. So for convenience, 
I have listed links to some interesting projects I did here in the README.

- An independent project I did for extra credit in cs430(algorithms) is here: 
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/cs430/huffman_encoding/src/huffman_encoding
     It finds the occurrence of each character/letter in a string and enters it along with its occurrence value into a tree using the Huffman/Sallows technique. 
     Then the program prints out the result in multiple formats.

- Here is an Android app I made by myself for an Interprofessional project:
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/ipro_app
     This is a demo app with an internal database and a lot of hard coded values.
     It was used to demo our business idea of creating a gift card exchange service app.
     Download the apk file on an android device to play around with the app.
     
- This directory contains some of the Android apps I made or expiremented with:
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/cs442
     I learned Android Dev in cs442 using these projects then I made some of my own.
  
- Computer Graphics homework:
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/cs411
     Not perfect, but I did my best. Hope to get back to this someday.
     
- Robotics independent study:
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/occ_projects/Robotics%20Arduino%20Proj
     This is how I got started in robotics with an Arduino board. 
     Then I went onto Raspberry Pi and had lots of fun with the robotics team at OCC.

- 1040ez Tax Calculator:
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/occ_projects/extra/1040ez_Tax_Project
     OUTPUT: https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/blob/master/occ_projects/1040ez_Tax_Project/ME_MYSELF's_Tax_Form.txt
     I took my first programming class and did an Honor's Project to push my learning to a new level.
     This Tax Calculator was my first independent project. I learned a lot and loved  it!

- Database work: 
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/cs425
     Made and maunipulated SQL databases then connected it to a java GUI app for a group project.
     
- Information Retrieval work:
     https://github.com/AyeshaAhmed/iit_projects/tree/master/cs429
