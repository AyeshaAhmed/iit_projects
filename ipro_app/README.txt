This was a demo app that I made based on my team members' requirements and class requirements.
The app-debug.apk file can be downloaded onto an android mobile device to use the app.
The GiftCardExchange folder contains all the source code used for the app.

In our inter-professional program class we needed to make an app that would help solve some commonly faced problem. 
So our team decided to make an app that would allow a user to exchange gift cards they didn't want for cash or
another gift card. This app demonstrates the user process and some data storage features the app would supposedly use.
